# Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
The **Inventory Management System** is a real-time, multi-store inventory tracking solution. It records sales, manages stock deliveries between branches, and sends low-stock warnings via email, ensuring smooth operations across all store locations. The system is implemented using Python and MySQL, offering an efficient way to manage inventory across multiple stores or within a single location.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Tracks products and parts from seller to storeroom, between storerooms, and finally to retail locations or customers.
- **Multi-Branch Support**: Connects multiple stores and manages inventory between them.
- **Email Alerts**: Automatically sends warnings when stock is low at any location.
- **Sales and Restocking Records**: Logs sales and restocking events for accurate inventory management.

## Objectives
- Ensure optimal inventory levels, avoiding both overstock and out-of-stock situations.
- Efficient resource management by minimizing inventory costs while maintaining operational needs.
- Protection against risks such as obsolescence and theft.
- Timely customer service with sufficient stock to meet demand.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Libraries**: Tkinter, Pandas, NumPy

## How It Works
1. **Real-Time Inventory Management**: Track inventory as it moves between stores and is sold or restocked.
2. **Automated Alerts**: Receive low-stock warnings via email for prompt restocking.
3. **Database Integration**: Store and manage all inventory data using MySQL for accurate reporting and management.
4. **User Interface**: Built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter for a simple, user-friendly interface.
